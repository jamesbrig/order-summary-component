hi, i'm a bit of a "newbie". I'm solid in HTML and intermediate in CSS. I"m trying to learn more about layout in CSS, particularly with Flexbox layout and Grid layout or advanced layout techniques.
I coded about 80% on my own but needed some help from chatgpt for making correct changes to CSS. I'm trying to become advanced in CSS. I might be teaching a small class at work on making 
simple video games with html, css and javascript. i know the basic fundamentals of computer programming but I still consider myself to be a beginner/intermediate in javascript.

With the order-summary-component I learned alot about how to use display:flex with flex:1 and flex-direction: column.  If you have any advice I would appreciate it.
